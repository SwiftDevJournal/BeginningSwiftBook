# Comments

Comments let you add notes to your code to help you understand what you're doing.

## Creating a Single Line Comment

When you add two forward slashes, `//`, everything after the slashes is treated as a comment until you press the Return key.

	// This is a single line comment.

Use single line comments for shorter comments that are a sentence or two.

## Creating a Longer Comment

Use comment blocks to create longer comments. A comment block starts with the characters `/*` and ends with the characters `*/`.

	/*
	This is a longer comment block that can span multiple paragraphs.
	
	Second paragraph here.
	
	More paragraphs here...
	
	*/
