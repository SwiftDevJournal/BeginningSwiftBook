# Variables

## Declaring a Variable

The following code demonstrates declaring a variable:

	var score: Int
	
The `var` keyword tells the compiler you're creating a variable. Next comes the name of the variable. A variable must start with a letter. Swift convention is to start a variable name with a lowercase letter and use uppercase letters for any additional words in the name. After naming the variable, enter a colon, a space, and the type of the variable.

You can avoid explicitly declaring a type by giving the variable an initial vale.

	var score = 0
	
By giving `score` the value zero, the Swift compiler knows the variable is an integer so you can avoid typing the colon and the type of variable.
