# Data Types

Every variable in a Swift program must have a data type. This section covers Swift's primitive data types.

## Integers

An integer is a counting number, such as 2, 5, 39, or 481. Swift has two kinds of integers: unsigned and signed. Unsigned integers do not have negative values while signed integers can have negative values.

A signed integer's type name is `Int`. An unsigned integer's type name is `UInt`.
