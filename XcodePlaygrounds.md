# Xcode Playgrounds

Xcode playgrounds let you experiment with Swift code. They're great for learning the Swift language.

## Creating a Playground

Launch Xcode and choose File> New > Playground to create a playground. The New Playground Assistant opens.

At the top are the three platforms Xcode playgrounds support: iOS, macOS, and tvOS. Click a platform. Each platform has the following playground templates:

* Blank
* Game
* Map
* Single View

In this book you will be creating blank templates. Select Blank and click the Next button.

A Save panel opens. Name the playground in the Save As text field. Choose a location to save the playground. Click the Create button to finish creating the playground.

## The Playground Window

The following screenshot shows the playground with various buttons and sections labeled:

The three main sections running left to right are the following:

* Navigator
* Editor
* Inspector

Above the editor is the jump bar. Below the editor is the console.

### Navigator

Xcode playgrounds have six navigators. There is a small button for each navigator at the top of the navigator. You can also press Cmd-1-6 to access the navigators.

* Project navigator
* Source control navigator
* Symbol navigator
* Find navigator
* Issue navigator
* Report navigator

Above the navigator is a button to toggle showing and hiding the navigator.

### Editor

The editor is where you type your Swift code. Next to the editor is a view where the output goes when you run the playground.
