# Tools Setup

## What Tools Do You Need to Write Swift Code?

If you have any interest in making iOS or Mac apps, the only tool you need is Xcode, which is Apple's app for making iOS and Mac apps.

### Where to Download Xcode

The easiest way to download Xcode is from the Mac App Store. One thing to keep in mind with Xcode is that it's a huge app. Expanding the compressed file you download and installing Xcode takes a lot of time, 1-2 hours. The LaunchPad app shows the progress of the installation.

#### Alternatives to the Mac App Store

One big issue with installing Xcode from the Mac App Store is the App Store only has the latest version. The latest Xcode version usually requires the latest version of macOS. If you are running an older version of macOS on your Mac, you must install Xcode from another source.

Apple has an [Xcode Downloads Page](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/resources/) where you can download older versions of Xcode. A faster way to access Apple's Xcode download links is from the site [Xcode Releases](https://xcodereleases.com). The Xcode Releases site also tells you the minimum macOS version that each Xcode version supports so you download and install the right version.

### I Don't Have a Mac

Xcode requires a Mac to run. If you have an iPad, you can install the [Swift Playgrounds app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/swift-playgrounds/id908519492). You can use the Swift Playgrounds app to learn Swift, but you can't develop iOS apps with it.

If you have a computer running Windows or Linux, you can [download Swift](https://swift.org/download/) and use a text editor like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com) to write Swift code. The download is for the Swift language itself. It does not include libraries for making iOS apps. Unless you plan on getting a Mac in the future, I recommend learning a language other than Swift.
