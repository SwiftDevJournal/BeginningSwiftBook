# BeginningSwiftBook

I have an idea for a short book that teaches the Swift language for people new to programming. A free, online version would work better on GitHub than on [Swift Dev Journal](https://swiftdevjournal.com) so I created these project with GitHub Pages. Hopefully there will be more material here in the future.
